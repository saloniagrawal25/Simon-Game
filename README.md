# Simon-Game

Simon is an electronic game of memory skill where it creates a series of tones and lights and requires the user to repeat the sequence. 

## Game Play

The device has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device.
A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. 
As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.
